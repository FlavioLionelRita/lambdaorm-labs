## CLI Lab - Northwind

In this laboratory we will see:

Creating the northwind sample database tables and loading it with sample data.
This database presents several non-standard cases such as:
	- Name of tables and fields with spaces
	- Tables with composite primary keys
	- Tables with autonumeric ids and others with ids strings

Since this is the database that was used for many examples and unit tests, you can test the example queries that are in the documentation.
We will also see some example queries to execute from CLI

## CLI Lab - Northwind multiple datasources

In this laboratory we will see:

- How to configure the schema to work with multiple data sources
- How to execute queries from CLI to obtain data from multiple data sources in the same query
- How to obtain the execution plan of a query and visualize which data sources the queries will be executed on
